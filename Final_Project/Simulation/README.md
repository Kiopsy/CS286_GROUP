How to make a map:
- Create a grid of space seperated numbers, where each number represents a different object type
    - 50: an obstacle
    - 00: a free space
    - -1: a robot
- Use the maps in the "Layouts" folder for examples

How to run:
- Set the "filename" variable in simulation.py on line 15 to the path of the map textfile of your choosing
- Run "python3 simulation.py"; the simulation results will be recorded in the "Frames" folder
